# KarpetJS

This is a copy (fork-like) repo of:
https://github.com/devballteam/Carpet.js

Mainly created for making a major change that couldn't be made on this fork, because some of the projects actually rely on it.
This repo exposes `carpetComponents` and `carpetModules` variables in order to be able to reload Carpet manually
